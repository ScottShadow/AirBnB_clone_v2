Introduction to Flask
Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python, perfect for building web applications quickly and easily. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to getting started with Flask.

Installation
To get started with Flask, you'll need to install it first. Follow these steps:

Installation: Install Flask using pip.
ruby
$ pip install flask
Setting up a project: Create a new directory for your Flask project.
Creating a virtual environment (optional but recommended): Set up a virtual environment for your project to manage dependencies.
Hello World: Create a minimal Flask application to ensure everything is set up correctly.
A Minimal Application
Here's an example of a minimal Flask application:

python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(**name**)

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
return "<p>Hello, World!</p>"
Explanation
Let's break down the code:

Import Flask: We import the Flask class, which is used to create our web application.
Create an instance of Flask: We create an instance of the Flask class, passing **name** as the first argument. This is a special Python variable that represents the name of the current module.
Define a route: We use the @app.route() decorator to specify the URL that will trigger our function (hello_world() in this case). In this example, the root URL ("/") will trigger the function.
Define a view function: The view function (hello_world()) returns the message we want to display in the user’s browser.
Running the Application
To run the application, save it as a Python file (e.g., hello.py) and use the Flask command or python -m flask. You need to tell Flask where your application is with the --app option.

bash
$ flask --app hello run
Output
You should see output similar to the following:

csharp

- Serving Flask app 'hello'
- Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
  Application Discovery Behavior
  If your file is named app.py or wsgi.py, you don’t need to use --app.

External Server Access
By default, the Flask development server is only accessible from your own computer. To make it publicly available, add --host=0.0.0.0 to the command line.

bash
$ flask run --host=0.0.0.0
Debug Mode
You can enable debug mode to automatically reload the server on code changes and show an interactive debugger in the browser if an error occurs during a request.

bash
$ flask --app hello run --debug
